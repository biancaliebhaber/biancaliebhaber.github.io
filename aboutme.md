## Hello! My name is Bianca.

🌐 **Background**
I’m a Senior Data Analyst with 5+ years in Business Intelligence, built on a foundation in research science and self-taught technical skills. I specialize in data ingestion, transformation, and visualization using tools like Amazon Redshift, Tableau, and SQL. I'm eager to apply my expertise to uncover insights and tackle new technical challenges.

📈 **What Drives Me**
I am motivated by a curiosity to learn! I feel most rewarded at work when I can apply my comprehensive stack of expertise to drive business insights across new programs and technical challenges.

🔍 **Passion for Public Speaking**
Beyond the professional realm, I am deeply passionate about Toastmasters, a public speaking club. Whether it's giving a talk on a company learning day, telling a good story at the dinner table or encouraging others to take the mic, I strive to be a strong leader with a big heart.

💪 **Outside of Work**
Check out my other passion, Iron Betties - a weightlifting club for women and non-binary individuals.
Since I founded the club in 2020, membership continues to climb as I introduce new meetup ideas, community-forward events and merchandise! All merchandise proceeds go to our Seattle non-profit of choice, Young Women Empowered (Y-WE).
