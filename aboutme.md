subtitle: Passionate Professional in Business Intelligence

🌐 **Background**
I am a Business Analyst with a proven track record in Business Intelligence. With a foundation in research science, I have harnessed my intellectual curiosity and analytical experience into the field of business intelligence for 5+ years.  

📈 **What Drives Me**
I am motivated by a curiosity to learn! I feel most rewarded at work when I can apply my comprehensive stack of expertise to drive business insights across new programs and technical challenges.

🔍 **Passion for Public Speaking**
Beyond the professional realm, I am deeply passionate about Toastmasters, a public speaking club. Whether it's giving a talk on a company learning day, telling a good story at the dinner table or encouraging others to take the mic, I strive to be a strong leader with a big heart.

💪 **Outside of Work**
Check out my other passion, Iron Betties - a weightlifting club for women and non-binary individuals.
Since I founded the club in 2020, membership continues to climb as I introduce new meetup ideas, community-forward events and merchandise! All proceeds go to our Seattle non-profit of choice, Young Women Empowered (Y-WE).
